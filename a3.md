# Part D: Reflections


## Reflection for Manjot Singh

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.

   => For this assignment i did coding for a3_partb.py and helped in the coding of a2d.py.
   
2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?

  => In this assignment i learned about heap which got imported into my code using `import heapq` it got used to efficiently make the     
      edges of the graph and i have learned about `Prim's algorithm` I used this algorithm to select the edges of graph according to   
      their graph.
     
3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?

=>For me the most challenging was used to understand the Prim's Algorithm as this was new concept for me and this is the first I am coding in Python. To overcome this problem I first read the course notes and then i went to YouTube for better understanding then i watched some videos on this topic by a YouTuber called `Code With Harry`. 

## Reflection for Manak Preet Singh

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.
#### In this particular assignment I coded the a3_partc.py file and also did the a1_partd.py file which was needed for the tester file test_a3_partc.py to run. Moreover, I also helped in coding the a2d.py file along with my other group member, Manjot Singh.

2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?
#### This assignment deepened my understanding of graph theory, teaching me maze generation techniques, random edge weight generation, and the application of minimum spanning tree algorithms. I gained practical insight into graph manipulation and problem-solving within maze structures, enhancing my knowledge of real-world graph applications.

3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?
#### The most challenging aspect was implementing the minimum spanning tree algorithm for maze creation. To overcome this, I studied the algorithm in-depth, consulted relevant resources, and iteratively tested and debugged the code. And, in the end, I was able to enhance my problem-solving skills and eventually achieved a successful implementation and finally completed this assignment.


## Reflection for Abhi

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.
I did a3_part a for this assignment for that I Organise the elements so that the smallest value can be rapidly retrieved, I designed a MinHeap class in Python. With the help of this class, you may add elements, retrieve the smallest element, and  determine whether the heap is empty.

2 What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?
I gained a deeper understanding of the various operations of a heap thanks to the assignment. I had theb fundamental grasp how the data structure works in heap. I recognised the effectivenees of theoritical and practical knowledge for data structure . 
   
3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?
The _heap_up method was particularly difficult to be accuratemaster. My initial strategy was convoluted with extraneous loops and conditions. I was able to streamline its execution by going through the fundamental ideas once more and making sure to take a targeted approach. Making sure that mathematical operations,  such as indexing was also one of the most difficult logic for me .Time management is also the issue as Exam are going on So managing work on time is the 3rd most important challenge for me
